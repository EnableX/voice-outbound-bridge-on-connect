# **Basic Client Examples to demonstrate Outbound Calls using Enablex Voice APIs. **
This example contains instructions how users can initiate Outbound Calls.


## Pre-requisite
- You will need Enablex Application credentials, APP ID and APP KEY. To find credentials, register with EnableX (https://portal.enablex.io/cpaas/trial-sign-up/).
- You will need a place for hosting this application either cloud or local machine.


## Installation
- `git clone https://github.com/EnableX/voice-api-outbound-ivr.git`
- `cd voice-api-outbound-ivr`
- `npm install`


## Setting up configurations using environment variables

For Mac and Linux, open a terminal window and type the following commands. Note - Replace all the characters after the = with values from your EnableX account:

- Set APP ID and APP KEY. It is required configuration.
  - `export ENABLEX_APP_ID=`
  - `export ENABLEX_APP_KEY=`

- Set port. Default port is set to 3000. It is an optional configuration.
  - `export SERVICE_PORT=`

For Windows:
  - Make a file with name ".env" in root directory. And copy content of .env.example in .env file. Then set these variables
  - `ENABLEX_APP_ID` , `ENABLEX_APP_KEY` , `SERVICE_PORT`.
  - Their explanation is given in Linux/Mac section (Upper section).


## Webhook - EnableX will send HTTP requests to your application (`/event`) after certain events occur.

For Mac and Linux, open a terminal window and type the following commands. Note - Replace all the characters after the = with values from your EnableX account:

- If you have deployed this service on a web server which is publicly accessible, set the public URL. Example - `https://{PUBLIC_URL}`
  - `export PUBLIC_WEBHOOK_URL=`
- If you want to test this service on a web server running locally on your own computer at a given port, with ngrok, you can generate URL that tunnels requests to your web server running locally. Once ngrok installed, run following -
  - `./ngrok http {SERVICE_PORT}` . It should provide you a ngrok URL something similar to `https://fc6c892d6cd7.ngrok.io`. Now, Set the ngrok URL. Example - `https://fc6c892d6cd7.ngrok.io`
    - `export PUBLIC_WEBHOOK_URL=`
- Set to run the service on http / https (false / true)
  - `export LISTEN_SSL=`
- Set the preferred voice for playing the text to speech prompt , Female or Male. 
    -  VOICE=Female
- Set the preferred language for playing the text to speech prompt. 
    -  LANGUAGE=en-US
- Set the text to ge played as prompt
    -  TEXT=Hi Good Morning . welcome to text to speech demo.
- Set the prompt reference that will be returned to identify the prompt that has been played in the response . 
    -  PROMPT_REF=text_to_speech_prompt
- Set the Called Id - the virtual number that has been bought and attached to the project.
    -  FROM=+1XXXXXXXXXX
- Set the destination number to be called.
    -  TO=+1XXXXXXXXXX
- Set the Bridge Number to be called
    - BRIDGETO=+1XXXXXXXXXX

For Windows

  - In .env file set these values `LISTEN_SSL=`, `PUBLIC_WEBHOOK_URL=`.
  - Their explanation is given in Linux/Mac section (Upper section).


## SSL Certificate (Self Signed or Registered). It is required configuration if LISTEN_SSL is set to true.

Mac/Linux

  - Make a directory called certs on the root of the project
    - `mkdir certs`
  - Change to certs directory
    - `cd certs`
  - Create and Install certificates
    - `openssl req -nodes -new -x509   -keyout example.key -out example.crt   -days 365   -subj '/CN=example.com/O=My Company Name LTD./C=US'; cat example.crt > example.ca-bundle`
  - use the certificate .key [self signed or registered]
    - `export CERTIFICATE_SSL_KEY=`
  - use the certificate .crt [self signed or registered]
    - `export CERTIFICATE_SSL_CERT=`
  - use the certificate CA[chain] [self signed or registered]
    - `export CERTIFICATE_SSL_CACERTS=`
  - switch to the root of the project
    - `cd ..`
  
Windows (Using Git Bash):
  - Make a directory called certs on the root of the project
    - `mkdir certs`
  - Change to certs directory
    - `cd certs`
  - Create and Install certificates
    - `openssl req -nodes -new -x509   -keyout example.key -out example.crt   -days 365` 
    - `cat example.crt > example.ca-bundle`
  - Update these fields manually in .env file if not given else you can ignore it. 
    - use the certificate .key [self signed or registered]
      - `CERTIFICATE_SSL_KEY=`
    - use the certificate .crt [self signed or registered]
      - `CERTIFICATE_SSL_CERT=`
    - use the certificate CA[chain] [self signed or  registered]
      - `CERTIFICATE_SSL_CACERTS=`
  - switch to the root of the project
    - `cd ..`

## Starting the client application script
- For Outbound Calls,
```
  - npm install
  - node client-outbound-ivr.js
  
```
